üëã Hi there, thank you so much, for giving a try to this project!
üöÄ For getting started, please take a look at `README.md`
üìö For learning more about forms please take a look at `forms.py`
üí° For learning more about prompts please take a look at `prompt.py`
ü•¥ There's not much to see about `utils.py`, but choice is yours

------------------------------QUICK START------------------------------
üîç You need to create client_secrets.json file using Google Cloud Console.
   The instructions are given `README.md`.
   Once you've created this file;
   ‚ú® Set `CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE` to /path/to/client_secrets.json.
   ‚ú® Set `FILE` variable to `CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE` (if not set already!)
   ‚ú® Then, run `python main.py`
   ‚ú® Enjoy!
üîç For updating a form instead of creating a new one:
   ‚ú® You need to set `FORM_ID` variable.
      To learn the form id, you need to check the link given to you:
      The link will have this format: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/{FORM_ID}
      You can just copy this id into your `FORM_ID` variable.
